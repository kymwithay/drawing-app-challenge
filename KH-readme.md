What aspect of your submission are you most proud of, and why?

I'm most proud of adding functionality to the pen where it has the ability to change line type between solid, dashed, and dotted. I've never worked with the Canvas API before, and wasn't quite sure how to implement it at first. While it took me a while to get familiar with exactly how it works, by implementing this functionality

What would you work on if you had more time?
Making the pen draw a combination of shapes and adding testing use cases.
